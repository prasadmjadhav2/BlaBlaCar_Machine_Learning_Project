# BlaBlaCar Machine Learning Project: Revolutionizing Ride-Sharing with AI ðŸš—

I am thrilled to share insights from my latest project with BlaBlaCar, where I applied advanced machine learning techniques to transform ride-sharing experiences. With a dataset of 100,000 rides and 57 features, the project explored innovative solutions to optimize pricing, predict demand, improve customer satisfaction, and ensure seamless operations.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset Highlights:

- **Size**: 100,000 rows, 57 features
- **Key Variables**: Distance, ride duration, driver ratings, passenger feedback, traffic/weather conditions, carbon emissions, and loyalty levels.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Key Use Cases & Solutions:

#### 1. Ride Demand Prediction:
- Developed a **time-series model (ARIMA)** to forecast ride demand based on time, location, and weather conditions, enabling better resource allocation.

#### 2. Dynamic Pricing Optimization:
- Implemented a **Gradient Boosting Regressor**, achieving a low **Mean Absolute Error** of 351.83, to dynamically adjust prices based on traffic, ride duration, and seat availability.

#### 3. ETA Prediction:
- Built an **XGBoost Regressor** for accurate **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)**, enhancing customer communication and reducing variance in arrival predictions.

#### 4. Customer Segmentation:
- Applied **KMeans clustering** to identify user segments based on loyalty levels, trip frequency, and satisfaction indices. This supports personalized marketing and improved user engagement.

#### 5. Anomaly Detection:
- Leveraged **Isolation Forest** to flag 1,000 anomalous rides, ensuring safety and detecting potential fraud patterns.

#### 6. Ride Cancellation Prediction:
- Trained an **AdaBoost Classifier** to predict cancellations, achieving a balanced **F1 Score** of 0.497, reducing service disruptions.

#### 7. Environmental Impact Analysis:
- Estimated **carbon emissions** using trip data and suggested eco-friendly alternatives to minimize environmental impact.

### ðŸ“ˆ Results & Impact:

- **Increased Efficiency**: Enhanced demand prediction accuracy and dynamic pricing improved operational performance.
- **Reduced Downtime**: Anomaly detection prevented issues in 1% of rides, boosting reliability.
- **Enhanced Sustainability**: Promoted eco-conscious travel by estimating and reducing carbon emissions.
